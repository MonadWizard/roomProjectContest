"""
We want to introduce the principles of multiple inheritance with an example.
For this purpose, we will implement to independent classes: a "Clock" and a "Calendar" class. After this,
we will introduce a class "CalendarClock", which is, as the name implies, a combination of "Clock" and "Calendar".
CalendarClock inherits both from "Clock" and "Calendar".

The class Clock is used to simulate a clock.
